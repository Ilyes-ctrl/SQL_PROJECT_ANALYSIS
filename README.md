To identify the highest-paying roles I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.
```sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND job_location = 'Anywhere'
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## 3. Top Demanded Skills
This section here retrieves the top 5 most in-demand skills for remote Data Analyst roles by querying a relational database. It joins job postings with their associated skills using the skills_job_dim and skills_dim tables, filters for job titles labeled as "Data Analyst" that are also remote (job_work_from_home = True), and then groups the results by skill. For each skill, it counts how many relevant job postings mention it (demand_count), sorts them in descending order of frequency, and limits the output to the top five. This helps identify the most commonly requested skills in high-demand remote data analyst positions.
```sql
SELECT
    skills,
    COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE 
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND job_work_from_home = True
GROUP BY 
    skills
ORDER BY
    demand_count DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
### 🚀 Top Demanded Data Skills

## 4. Top Paying Skills
This section of SQL code is used to identify the top-paying technical skills required for remote Data Analyst roles. It works by joining job postings with their associated skill tags, filtering the data to include only jobs with a known annual salary and marked as "work from home." We then group the data by each skill and calculate the average salary associated with that skill across all relevant postings. Finally, the query sorts the skills by average salary in descending order and limits the result to the top 25 highest-paying skills, providing insight into which tools or technologies are most financially rewarding in the data analytics job market.
```sql
SELECT
    skills,
    ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg), 0) AS avg_salary
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE 
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    AND job_work_from_home = True
GROUP BY 
    skills
ORDER BY
    avg_salary DESC
LIMIT 25;
```

*The table presents the top 25 data-related skills associated with the highest average annual salaries in remote Data Analyst job postings. It provides insight into the most financially rewarding technical competencies in the field.*

## 5. Optimal Skills
This SQL query aims to identify the top 25 most valuable technical skills for remote Data Analyst positions by combining both market demand and average salary data. It first calculates the number of job postings mentioning each skill, filtered for remote roles with non-null salary information. Simultaneously, it computes the average annual salary associated with each skill using the same filters. The results are then merged, excluding skills with low demand (10 or fewer mentions), and sorted in descending order of average salary and demand. This method provides a clear, data-driven overview of which skills are most sought after and financially rewarding in the current remote job market for Data Analysts.
```sql
WITH skills_demand AS (
    SELECT
        skills_dim.skill_id,
        skills_dim.skills,
        COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count

    WHERE 
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
        AND job_work_from_home = TRUE
        AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY 
        skills_dim.skill_id
), average_salary AS (
    SELECT
